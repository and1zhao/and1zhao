### Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Zhao and I'm a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Statistics. I think an interesting intersection of my two majors is the quantitative world, and so I'm trying to educate myself on trading and the stock market in general to familiarize myself with this world!

In my free time, I enjoy catching up on the latest NBA and NFL games. In fact, my friends and I created a podcast called [Bursting the Bubble](https://redcircle.com/shows/the-four-horsemen), available on most major platforms. I would very much appreciate it if you would give it a listen and perhaps give it a follow!

I also have my own personal website where I talk more in depth about current college and work experiences: you can find it [here](https://andywzhao.com)!

Feel free to reach out to me just to talk! You can contact me on [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] or on [![Twitter][1.2]][1]. Happy to talk with you!
